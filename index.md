Chambana.net is a project of <a href="http://www.acornactivemedia.com/">Acorn Active Media</a> that seeks to provide low-cost web hosting services to non-profit organizations, small businesses, and individuals, both locally and internationally, by collectivizing the use of uplink bandwidth on a shared internet connection.

## Philosophy

The Chambana.net service is founded on three basic notions:

* to make available low-cost but wide-ranging web hosting and co-location services to the non-profit and independent business community
* to not provide over inflated or under-utilized bundled services 
* to offer such low-cost service by allowing clients to self-administer their sites and services without worrying about basic server and Internet connection maintenance and administration.

Chambana.net service users are expected to have the expertise or skills necessary to implement the web services they desire. Commensurately, technically competent users are not forced to pay for advanced technical support services that they do not need. Chambana.net service users are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the various free and low-cost computer learning opportunities offered in the community.
